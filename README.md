# Coffee Shop

A E-Commerce Coffee shop where fun random items are sold!

This project was built under a time crunch of a week at the FullStack Academy. This was built with Agile methodologies in a team of 4 other developers


## Setup

To preview this, you will need `Postgres`, `Node.js`, and `NPM` installed on your machine

In order to fully install all packages & dependencies:
`npm install` in your run time environment

You must then need to create a databse with Postgres called 'covfefe':
`createdb covfefe`

To View Products and load our databse with test data run:
`npm run seed`

Finally:

`npm run start-dev` and start shopping!
